For this part of the program, the user has chosen to add a new activity into the calendar. 
Once the user selects 'add', they will be prompted to add an activity name, role, year and month, 
then once the user has entered all of the items prompted for the ArrayList will be updated and the 
CSV file will be updated with the new ArrayList, which includes the new activity entered by the user.
The only message that will be seen by the user once they have entered the new activity is, "Activity 
Successfully Added".
